# Hey there, I'm Ravin Bandara ü§ì

Full-Stack Developer | DevOps Explorer | Code Tinkerer  

I turn coffee into code, bugs into features, and cloud chaos into reliable deployments.  
Mostly focused on **Full-Stack Development** and **DevOps**, but always curious about what‚Äôs next.

## What I Actually Do
- Build end-to-end web apps with **React, Next.js, Spring Boot, .NET, and Go**  
- Automate deployments so my servers don‚Äôt complain  
- Keep systems reliable and scalable, because downtime is scary  
- Experiment with **machine learning** and other ‚Äúfun stuff‚Äù

## Tech I Like to Play With
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Backend:** Spring Boot, .NET, Go, Node.js  
**DevOps & Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD, Terraform  
**Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  

## Fun Facts
- I contribute to open-source because sharing is caring  
- I optimize code and coffee intake with equal passion  
- Learning never stops, and neither does my curiosity
